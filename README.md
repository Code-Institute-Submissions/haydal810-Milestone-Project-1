# Glencar, County Kerry, IRELAND

This is a website about the place where I grew up: Glencar, County Kerry, Ireland. I have always thought that this area had huge potential for tourism, and that not many people outside the area even knew about the place. So I decided to design a website, to advise and promote the area. 

The website has information of Outdoor Activities, places to eat & drink, local accommodation and a contact page for further information. 
This promotes the local businesses in the area, and in turn, will hopefully encourage more visitors to the region.

In the future, I will make the website live in the public domain, and give the option for individuals and business's to contribute to the website and promote their part of Glencar.

## UX

This website has been designed for anyone who doesn't know about the area of Glencar. The website gives information about the area to the visitor: What to see & do, where to eat and what accommodation is available in the area. The website gives a brief outline about each item, and refers to a link at the end of each item, directing them to an external site, where the visitor can view further information about that item. --DH

Client Stories:
As a new visitor to the website, I want to easily navigate the site, regardless of device used, so I can find what I need efficiently.
As a new visitor to the website, I want to find out about things to do in the area, so I can decide if it's worth my while visiting the area.
As a new visitor to the website, I want to know if it's possible what accomodation is available locally, in case I decide to stay in the area for longer than a day.

### Existing Features
- Header Navigation Bar - This is one the top of every page, and allows all users to easily navigate all the website's pages and find what they are looking for. 
- Footer Social Media Links - This is on the bottom of every page, and allows all users to explore external content in social media, relevant to the subject of the website.

- Call to Action Buttons - These are in every page of the website, except for the home page, and they are found at the end of an item description. They allow all users to explore external content, via an external webpage, relevant to the subject of the content item.

- Youtube Videos (2x) - These are present on the "activities" page of the website, but only appear for medium and above devices. They give further insight to the item they are along side.

- Contact Form - Allows visitors to ask the owner of the website questions, such as further info, etc.


For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

Possible additional features to be implemented in the future:
I would lie to add a further page to the website in the future, where visitors can leave "stories" of their experiences in the area. This would provide good feedback for the locals of Glencar, and insight for potential new visitors.

### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea
- TBA...

## Technologies Used

- This project uses HTML and CSS programming languages.

Other technologies used:
 - Cloud9 - This was used as the IDE for building the website. https://c9.io/login
 - BootstrapCDN - The project uses Bootstrap4 to simplify the structure of the website and make the website responsive easily. https://getbootstrap.com/
 - Fontawesome - Used to provide icons from FontAwesome throughtout the site. https://fontawesome.com/
 - Google Fonts - The project uses Google fonts to style the website fonts. https://fonts.google.com/
 - AutoPrefixer - This project used AutoPrefixer to make sure the css code is valid for all browsers. https://autoprefixer.github.io/

 - Popper.js - This project uses Popper.js to reference Javascript, needed for the responsive navbar. https://popper.js.org/

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This project was developed using the Cloud9 IDE, committed to git and pushed to GitHub using the built in function within cloud9.

From there it was deployed to GitHub Pages from its GitHub repository.

The website is published here: https://haydal810.github.io/Milestone-Project-1/







This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
