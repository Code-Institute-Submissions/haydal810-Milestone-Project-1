# Glencar, County Kerry, IRELAND

This is a website about the place where I grew up: Glencar, County Kerry, Ireland. I have always thought that this area had huge potential for tourism, and that not many people outside the area even knew about the place. So I decided to design a website, to advise and promote the area. 

The website has information of Outdoor Activities, places to eat & drink, local accommodation and a contact page for further information. 
This promotes the local businesses in the area, and in turn, will hopefully encourage more visitors to the region.

In the future, I will make the website live in the public domain, and give the option for individuals and business's to contribute to the website and promote their part of Glencar.

## UX

This website has been designed for anyone who doesn't know about the area of Glencar. The website gives information about the area to the visitor: What to see & do, where to eat and what accommodation is available in the area. The website gives a brief outline about each item, and refers to a link at the end of each item, directing them to an external site, where the visitor can get further information about that item. 

### User Stories:
* As a new visitor to the website, I want to easily navigate the site, regardless of device used, so I can find what I need efficiently.
* As a new visitor to the website, I want to find out about things to do in the area, so I can decide if it's worth visiting the area.
* As a new visitor to the website, I want to find out where to eat & drink in the area, so I can decide if it's worth visiting the area.
* As a new visitor to the website, I want to know if it's possible what accomodation is available locally, in case I decide to stay in the area for longer than a day.
* As a visitor to the website, I want to contact the person in charge of the website, to discuss how I want my local business to be mentioned on the website.

## Features

### Home (Landing Page, "Logo in Navigation bar on the top left side")
The User is met with a vivid and colourful landing screen and welcome message. Navigation Bar is located on top, (and on top of all the other pages)
In the middle of the page, it gives the user the location fo the area, supported with a Google Location Map.
The bottom of the page is occupied by the footer, which has a background image from Glencar, along with some more welcome text and links to social media.

### Outdoor Activities Page (Nav Item 1)
Again, the user is met with a vivid and colourful image from the area, with accompanying title text, advising the user of where they are within the website. Scrolling down, there are three activities. Each one has a description, and accompanying Youtube Video / Map. Footer is at bottom of page, same as Home page.

### Food & Drink Page (Nav Item 2)
Again, the user is met with a vivid and colourful image, but this time it's a generic picture of a Pint of Guinness & food, with accompanying title text, advising the user of where they are within the website. Scrolling down, there are two locations named. Each one has a description and link for further information. Footer is at bottom of page, same as Home page.

### Accomodation Page (Nav Item 3)
Again, the user is met with a vivid and colourful image, with accompanying title text, advising the user of where they are within the website. Scrolling down, there are two locations named. Each one has a description and link for further information. Footer is at bottom of page, same as Home page.

### Contact Page (Nav Item 4)
The user is met with another vivid and colourful image, from the area, with accompanying title text, advising the user of where they are within the website. Scrolling down, there is a form for the user to fill out, if he/she wishes to contact the owner of the site for more information.
Footer is at bottom of page, same as Home page.


### Existing Features
* Header Navigation Bar - This is one the top of every page, and allows all users to easily navigate all the website's pages and find what they are looking for. 
* Footer Social Media Links - This is on the bottom of every page, and allows all users to explore external content in social media, relevant to the subject of the website.

* Call to Action Buttons - These are in every page of the website, except for the home page, and they are found at the end of an item description. They allow all users to explore external content, via an external webpage, relevant to the subject of the content item.

* Youtube Videos (2x) - These are present on the "activities" page of the website, but only appear for medium and above devices. They give further insight to the item they are along side.

* Contact Form - Allows visitors to ask the owner of the website questions, such as further info, etc.

### Features Left to Implement
* Backend knowledge required and later to be implemented for the information collected from the contact form section of the website.
* Events section, detailing upcoming local events.
* Implement an option to change the language of the website, as Glencar as many visitors from Germany & France who hill-walk and fish in the local area.
* I would lie to add a further page to the website in the future, where visitors can leave "stories" of their experiences in the area. This would provide good feedback for the locals of Glencar, and insight for potential new visitors.
* I would also like to show a window somewhere in the website that would show a feed from the Glencar Facebook page, which gets updated weekly. This would give the website content that would update automatically.
