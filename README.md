# Glencar, County Kerry, IRELAND

This is a website about the place where I grew up: Glencar, County Kerry, Ireland. I have always thought that this area had huge potential for tourism, and that not many people outside the area even knew about the place. So I decided to design a website, to advise and promote the area. 

The website has information of Outdoor Activities, places to eat & drink, local accommodation and a contact page for further information. 
This promotes the local businesses in the area, and in turn, will hopefully encourage more visitors to the region.

In the future, I will make the website live in the public domain, and give the option for individuals and business's to contribute to the website and promote their part of Glencar.

## UX

This website has been designed for anyone who doesn't know about the area of Glencar. The website gives information about the area to the visitor: What to see & do, where to eat and what accommodation is available in the area. The website gives a brief outline about each item, and refers to a link at the end of each item, directing them to an external site, where the visitor can view further information about that item. --DH

### Features Left to Implement
- Backend knowledge required and later to be implemented for the information collected from the contact form section of the website.

- Implement an option to change the language of the website, as Glencar as many visitors from Germany & France who hill-walk and fish in the local area.
- I would lie to add a further page to the website in the future, where visitors can leave "stories" of their experiences in the area. This would provide good feedback for the locals of Glencar, and insight for potential new visitors.
